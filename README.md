This app was cloned from a Heroku starter.

The algorithm was translated from the Fortran-77 Jacobi diagonalization routine from the classic "Numerical Recipes" book.

To do:

- put links to portfolio and repo on both pages

- flesh out background/instructions page

- make code more Java-ish, including the replacement of generic loops w/array methods

- generalize this from real matrices to hermitian matrices

- create favicon.ico route?
